I handled implementation of generating a random map each play session. Custom size parameters would be input depending on the size of map a user would like to play on. After the base map is created a path is randomly generated from one side of the map to the other for enemies to follow. Finally all environmental assets are placed by a random/behaviour algorithm on certain tiles. I also handled all functionality of purchasing defensive towers and placement of these towers, as well as removing environmental assets, that are in the way.
